# code_quiz

This project was to create an online quiz to help brush up on my coding knowledge and to help learn more about coding in the process.

This is avalible online for others to use and you can keep track of your highscore so you can challenge your friends(though only on the same computer).

When loaded the page should look like this and all you need to do is click on the start quiz button to start the quiz. You can see your highscores by clicking the hyperlink in the top right of the quiz page.
